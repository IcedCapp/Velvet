        Velvet contains many utility objects and packages. The Vector class is one of the core examples. The Vector class stores a 2d coordinate. Many of Velvet's UI and core objects rely on the Vector class to store their positions and sizes. The Vector class contains many built in functions for vector arithmetic, transformations such as rotations and scaling, distance and angle calculations, and more.
